Hi, I am Siung Kim.

If you are a Python developer, you might come across my packages with the namespace `crimson` from time to time in the near future. If you're skeptical, try the [IntelliType](https://github.com/crimson206/intelli-type) module first. Now, I can't develop other modules without it.

I have bachelor's and master's degrees in Physics. Since experiencing ChatGPT, I have dedicated all my time and background to AI. While studying and developing AI applications, I grew tired of the instability and messy code in many AI-related modules. Although the AI field is rapidly growing, it will take time to stabilize.

I also decided to focus on stabilization first. If you share this sentiment, please follow me.

## Interests

- Establishing New Development Style
- Clean Code
- LLM-based Multi-modal Applications
- AI-based Automation

## Collaboration

**Development Environment**

- I am establishing a new development style called 'Micro-wise Development'. If you want to apply this to your company, please contact me.

**Automation & Clean Code**

- I am a very lazy person. I really hate working on repetitive tasks. That is why I am investing 60-70 hours a week to automate them. I used to dislike writing docstrings due to their redundancy, but now I enjoy it thanks to [IntelliType](https://github.com/crimson206/intelli-type). The module is also based on my automation and clean code skills. If you want to apply the same standards in your company or institution, please contact me.

**AI Applications**

- I started everything because of AI. Even if things don't seem related to AI, I always think about integrating AI. If your company works with AI and you want to hear my perspectives as a DevOps & AI Application developer, please contact me.

## Programming Languages

- **Python: Advanced**\
 I currently publish many small PyPI modules. I have projects such as 'Micro-wise Development' and 'Python Storybook'.

- **TypeScript: Intermediate**\
 I started TypeScript to develop my own AI applications. I am interested in Python-Typescript integration based on [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs), which is the 'Python Storybook' project.

## Projects

### Micro-wise Development

- **Initiation**: This project was inspired by Storybook, or component-driven development. In Storybook, each component is developed and tested separately, and you can generate dedicated examples for each component. I decided to import this concept to Python.

- **Repository**: Please check the [repository](https://github.com/crimson206/microwise-development) for general information.

### Python-Storybook

The purpose of this project is to generate Storybook (TypeScript) components automatically from Python functions. Visit the [Prototype](https://6691601188f3f72d8d939beb-mszvyduajt.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/introduction--docs) for the example and introduction.


**Further Usage**

While the initial goal is to create automated interactive docs of Python modules, the automatically imported functions in TypeScript can be used for further purposes.

- **Autodocs of Storybook**\
 Check my [IntelliType](https://github.com/crimson206/intelli-type) and [AutoPydantic](https://github.com/crimson206/auto-pydantic) modules. I am a Python type hint expert. To get [specified interfaces](https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/controls) for each argument for Stories, such as radio buttons, select boxes, etc., we need to add one more annotation. I, as the developer, have to touch the TypeScript scripts to implement it, and you, as users, will set the annotation just in the Python script. For this, we can generate special types like `arg1: Range(int, (1, 10])`.

- **Publish as Components**\
 I initially started this project to componentize AI applications in Python. You can develop a complete RAG or ChatBot application solely in Python scripts, push it to Python-Storybook, and have your AI web application without additional front-end efforts.

- **Extensions**\
 Storybook extends its functionalities using add-ons. If you start using Python-Storybook, you will definitely want to learn TypeScript as well. We can use different [Storybook add-ons](https://storybook.js.org/docs/addons) for extensibility, or develop our own add-ons on the TypeScript or Python side.
