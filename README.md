### [IntelliType](https://github.com/crimson206/intelli-type)
IntelliType is a Python module that enhances code documentation by adding [hover-capable](https://github.com/crimson206/intelli-type?tab=readme-ov-file#autopydantic) docstrings to type hints, improving code readability and documentation. This feature makes IntelliType an essential tool for developing other modules with clean and maintainable code.
